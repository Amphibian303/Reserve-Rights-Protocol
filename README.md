# Reserve Rights: A Decentralized and Stable solution to Money
---
## An overview of The Reserve Rights native tokens _RSV_ and _RSR_

The Reserve Protocol is a stablecoin platform built on top on Ethereum. It uses a dual token system, RSV and RSR. RSV is the stablecoin that can be utilized the way all stablecoins are used, as stable currency in a digital environment. RSV is unique to most mainstream stablecoins because it’s backed by many different assets, both digital and analog. RSR acts as a utility token that helps keep RSV stable in price. RSR can fluctuate in price. The balancing nature between these two tokens helps protect Reserve users against volatility.

Funding for The Reserve Rights Protocol has been heavily covered on online media outlets with most of them claiming to be in the tens of millions of dollars. The most recent injection of cash the team received was by Pay Pal and Coinbase who combined added another 5 million dollars to the Reserve project in what they called "a developmental-stage seed round" of funding.  

CEO Nevin Freeman has even admitted on one of his YouTube videos that Reserve has "in a very unique position and has access to a very long runway of funding available to them".

## The Path to Reserve and why the world needs it
---
Reserve Rights mission statement reads as follows:

"We believe that everyone’s money should be secure. Billions of people around the world don't have a safe place to store their money. Banks in some countries can't be trusted, and some governments inflate their own currency to pay off debts, hurting citizens in the process.

With a few exceptions (money laundering, terrorist financing), we believe anyone in the world should be able to transact with anyone else. This requires low-friction, cross-border transactions, which are surprisingly hard to do in many cases today.

That's the reason for creating a stable, decentralized currency that can’t be abused by a government, because it is globally distributed outside of anyone’s control, and thus nearly impossible to shut down."

## Corrupt government officials leading to 'fiat inflation'
In places like Venezuela, inflation is apart of everyday life for those who live in the country. Hyperinflation in Venezuela is the currency instability in Venezuela that began in 2016 during the country's ongoing socioeconomic and political crisis. Venezuela began experiencing continuous and uninterrupted inflation in 1983, with double-digit annual inflation rates. Inflation rates became the highest in the world in 2014 and continued to increase in the following years, with inflation exceeding 1,000,000% by 2018.

## The Challenge - In the words of 'The Reserve'
"Today, Reserve's users are primarily normal people and business owners in Venezuela. We help them save in dollars and transact with low friction. They can cash-in and cash-out with PayPal, Zelle, and Venezuelan bank transfers. For example, to cash-in, users initiate a transaction in our app, then are prompted to make a transfer with whatever payment method they have selected. That transfer is received by one of the traders in our network, who responds by sending the user RSV – this can be automated or manual, depending on the payment method. Once the user has RSV, transactions between users are simple. If a user wants to cash-out some funds they have received in RSV, they can use the same process in reverse, and receive a transfer from one of the traders in our network. The traders sell RSV for a little more than they buy it back for, so they make their money on the difference."

"This itself is a fully functional product with a growing user-base, but it's just the start of our product vision. We plan to extend this cash-in and cash-out network to span the entire globe. We also plan to go way beyond just offering users the ability to make basic transactions – think payroll, automated cross-currency transactions, incoming and outgoing card payments, and so on."

In the last week of March 2021, Reserve was the #1 most downloaded finance app in Venezuela, surpassing100,000 total downloads.

## The Technology

The Reserve Protocol interacts with three kinds of tokens:

The Reserve token (RSV) — a stable cryptocurrency that can be held and spent the way we use US dollars and other stable fiat money.
The Reserve Rights token (RSR) — a cryptocurrency used to facilitate the stability of the Reserve token.
Collateral tokens — other assets that are held by the Reserve smart contract in order to back the value of the Reserve token, similar to when the US government used to back the US dollar with gold. The protocol is designed to hold collateral tokens worth at least 100% of the value of all Reserve tokens. Many of the collateral tokens will be tokenized real-world assets such as tokenized bonds, property, and commodities. The portfolio will start off relatively simple and diversify over time as more asset classes are tokenized.

# How the Reserve Token is Stabilized:

If demand goes down for the Reserve token, prices are expected to fall on secondary markets. What happens then?

Suppose the redemption price of Reserve is $1.00. If the price of Reserve on the open market is $0.98, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to buy it up and redeem it with the Reserve smart contract for $1.00 worth of collateral tokens. They'll continue buying on open markets until there is no more money to be made, which is when the market price matches the redemption price of $1.00.

The same mechanism works in reverse when demand goes up. If the price of Reserve on the open market is $1.02, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to purchase newly minted Reserve tokens for $1.00 worth of either collateral or Reserve Rights tokens (the latter only if there is an excess pool of Reserve tokens available), and immediately sell them on the open market. They'll continue selling on open markets until there is no more money to be made, which is when the market price matches the purchase price of $1.00.

# How the Reserve Protocol is Capitalized:

The Reserve Protocol holds the collateral tokens that back the Reserve token. When new Reserves are sold on the market, the assets used by market participants to purchase the new Reserves are held as collateral. This process keeps the Reserve collateralized at a 1:1 ratio even as supply increases.

At times, the Reserve Protocol may target a collateralization ratio greater than 1:1. When this is the case, scaling the supply of Reserve tokens requires additional capital in order to maintain the target collateralization ratio. To accomplish this the Reserve Protocol mints and sells Reserve Rights tokens in exchange for additional collateral tokens.

# What Happens When the Collateral Tokens Depreciate:

Collateral tokens are somewhat volatile. While we may be able to select a portfolio with minimal downside risk, the reality is that drops in the collateral tokens' value will happen. When this happens, the Reserve Protocol will sell newly minted Reserve Rights tokens for additional collateral tokens and add them to the backing.
