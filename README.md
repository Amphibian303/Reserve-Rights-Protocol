# Reserve Rights: A Decentralized and Stable solution to Money

## An overview of The Reserve Rights native tokens _RSV_ and _RSR_

The Reserve Protocol is a stablecoin platform built on top on Ethereum. It uses a dual token system, RSV and RSR. RSV is the stablecoin that can be utilized the way all stablecoins are used, as stable currency in a digital environment. RSV is unique to most mainstream stablecoins because itâ€™s backed by many different assets, both digital and analog. RSR acts as a utility token that helps keep RSV stable in price. RSR can fluctuate in price. The balancing nature between these two tokens helps protect Reserve users against volatility.
